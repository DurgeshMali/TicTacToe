# TicTacToe
The Tic-tac-toe app in the android studio is a beginner-friendly application, where the first screen will ask for both the player’s name, and then the game will start on another page where there will be a grid and two player names.

After, the game ends a dialog box will appear which will show the winner’s name and a start again button. When we click on the start again button then again the game will start from scratch.
